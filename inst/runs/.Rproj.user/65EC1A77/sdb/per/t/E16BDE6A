For text file any extension will be OK, for Excel you must use .xlsx (the latest verion). If you want to use the Excel file format, you must check the <strong>using Excel</strong> checkbox.\n  <li> <strong>column selection</strong> - Enter the number of the column containing the RR intervals in the appropriate window. If you have flags, enter the number of the column holding them after a space or a comma. The 0 flag means <em>correct</em>, or of sinus origin. Select the separator (what you have beteen the columns in the text file) from the drop down menu.\n<li> <strong>time based filtering</strong> - Enter values to filter the RR intervals based on time. The first value sets the RR intervals that you consider too short to be of sinus origin, the second ones selects the intervals you consider too long to be of sinus origin.\n</ul>\")\n}\nlibrary(shiny)\nshinyUI(\n  fluidPage(\n    titlePanel(\"Mapping of a time-series to rising, falling and neutral runs\"),\n    fluidRow(\n      column(3,\n             wellPanel(\n               checkboxInput(\"usingExcel\", \"using Excel\", value = FALSE),\n               fileInput('files', label=\"load files in the correct format - see explanations on the left\", multiple=TRUE),\n               selectInput(\"separator\", \"select separator\",\n                           list(\"tabulator\", \",\", \";\", \"space\")),\n               textInput(\"data_columns\", \"enter the column for RR intervals and flags - see explanations\", \"1 2\"),\n               textInput(\"minmax\",\"enter minimum and maximum acceptable RR length\", \"0 3000\")\n             )\n      ),\n      column(6,tabsetPanel(\n        tabPanel(\"Numerical results\", tags$style(type=\"text/css\", \"#filesRunsView { overflow-x: auto; max-width: 100%; }\"),\n                 tableOutput(\"filesRunsView\"),\n                 downloadButton('downloadResults', 'Download results as Excel file'))\n      )),\n      \n      column(3, HTML(paste(\"<h4>Explanation</h4>\",runs_description()))\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n",
